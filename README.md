# data-analytics-power-bi-report19

This directory contains a .pbix (Power BI) file and a several csv files that contribute to the handful of databases on the Power BI report. 

This project is guided and motivated the course designers at AiCore. I am basically following the steps in that program. Thus I will enumerate process and function according to their guide. AiCore labels overarching goals as *milestones*, with steps taken to reach each goal being called *tasks*.

## Milestones (overarching tasks/goals): 
1. Set up the environment. 
2. Import data into PBI. 
3. Create Data Model. 
4. Set up Report. 
5. Build the Customer Detail Page. 
6. Create an Executive Summary Page. 
7. Create a Product Detail Page.
8. Create a Stores Map Page. 
9. Cross-Filtering and Navigation. 
10. Create Metrics for Users Outside the Company Using SQL. 

### Milestone 1. 
At long last having a Windows computer is an advantage in AiCore. Windows already *is* Power BI's natural habitat. 

### Milestone 2. 
Complete as of 04/03/24. In Summary, used multiple sources of data to load in Orders, analytics, Customers, and Products databases. Cleaned data according to AiCore guidelines. Column names allowed spaces, table names (tables, aka queries, contian columns) must be underscored or single-worded. Two extra db's came along with Orders because I couldn't seem to load a single database, but I could load the whole cohort of db's on the Azure SQL server. Because I wasn't sure which table was the 'orders' they intended for me to load, I kept both, labelling the one with more information as 'orders_more_info.' 

### Milestone 3.
